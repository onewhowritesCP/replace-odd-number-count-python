# replace-odd-number-count-python
"It reads integers from the standard input (until it gets a negative number) and puts them into an array.
Any sequence of two or more consecutive odd numbers in the array are removed from the array and replaced by a single number representing the length of that sequence.
For example, if these numbers were provided on the standard input:[222,3,35,62,124,61,29,375,66,7,-1]
output:[222, 2, 62, 124, 3, 66, 7]
